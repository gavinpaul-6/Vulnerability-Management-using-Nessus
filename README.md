# Vulnerability Management with Nessus

<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a comprehensive, hands-on walkthrough of the vulnerability scanning and remediation process. It utilizes Nessus Essentials for conducting authenticated scans on virtual machines hosted within VMWare Workstation. Throughout this project, I will demonstrate the steps involved in identifying vulnerabilities, applying remediation measures, and validating their success via a follow-up scan. This hands-on experience contributes significantly to my comprehension of essential aspects within the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.

<h2>Tools Used:</h2>

- Nessus

<h2>Environments:</h2>

- VMWare Workstation Pro
- Windows 10 ISO (21H1)
- Deprecated version of Firefox


<h2>Lab Steps:</h2>

  <p><b>First I downloaded Nessus:</b></p>

  <p>Made sure my VM had connection and got the IP address:</p>

  <p>After I got my IP address, I initiated a basic non-credentialed scan on Nessus:</p>

  <p>I went and made a few configurations. I opened Services and enabled Remote Registry which iwll allow the scanner to connect to the VM's registry.
  
  
  Next, I verified that File and Printer Sharing in the Advanced Sharing Settings.

<p>To complete a credentialed scan, I entered the credentials of the VM.</p>

  <p>These were the results after completing a second scan, first credential scan which shows more vulnerabilites with some Criticals and Highs.</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-12.png" alt="" />

<p>I installed a very old version of Firefox</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-8.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-9.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-10.png" alt="" />


  <p>These were the results of the Firefox installation:</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-12.png" alt="" />

  <P> To remediate, I uninstalled Firefox and ran Windows Updates and restarted the Windows 10 VM. I had to run another Windows Update and restart again.</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-15.png" alt="" />

  <p>After completing another scan, I observed that Internet Explorer was still enabled on this VM. Internet Explorer was popular browser in the early-mid 2000s prior to the addition of Firefox, Chrome and Microsoft's own replacement for IE, Microsoft Edge. In June 2022, Microsoft announced the Internet Explorer 11 desktop application went out of support for certain operating systems starting June 15, 2022</p>

 <h2>Remediation</h2>

Upon concluding the scans and conducting configuration testing on my Windows 10 virtual machine through Nessus, I proactively addressed the identified issues. This involved the installation of all accessible updates and the removal of an outdated Firefox version, a potential security threat. The primary aim here was to illustrate how applications can significantly influence a system and expose vulnerabilities.

In summary, this project serves as a testament to my grasp of vulnerability management and a foundational understanding of the vulnerability life cycle. It lays the groundwork for my continued progression and advancement in this field.
