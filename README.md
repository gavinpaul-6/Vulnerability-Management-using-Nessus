# Vulnerability Management with Nessus

<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a comprehensive, hands-on walkthrough of the vulnerability scanning and remediation process. It utilizes Nessus Essentials for conducting authenticated scans on virtual machines hosted within VMWare Workstation. Throughout this project, I will demonstrate the steps involved in identifying vulnerabilities, applying remediation measures, and validating their success via a follow-up scan. This hands-on experience contributes significantly to my comprehension of essential aspects within the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.

<h2>Tools Used:</h2>

- Nessus

<h2>Environments:</h2>

- VMWare Workstation Pro
- Windows 10 ISO (21H1)
- Deprecated version of Firefox


<h2>Lab Steps:</h2>

  <p>First I downloaded Nessus:</p>

  <p>Made sure my VM had connection and got the IP address:</p>
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-2.png" alt="" />

  <p>After I got my IP address, I did my first scan on Nessus with no configurations:</p>
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-3.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-4.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-5.1.png" alt="" />
  
  <p>I went and made a few configurations and downloaded a very old Version of Firefox:</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-6.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-7.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-8.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-9.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-10.png" alt="" />
