# Vulnerability Management with Nessus

<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a comprehensive, hands-on walkthrough of the vulnerability scanning and remediation process. It utilizes Nessus Essentials for conducting authenticated scans on virtual machines hosted within VMWare Workstation. Throughout this project, I will demonstrate the steps involved in identifying vulnerabilities, applying remediation measures, and validating their success via a follow-up scan. This hands-on experience contributes significantly to my comprehension of essential aspects within the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.

<h2>Tools Used:</h2>

- Nessus

<h2>Environments:</h2>

- VMWare Workstation Pro
- Windows 10 ISO (21H1)
- Deprecated version of Firefox


<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>The Nessus vulnerability scanner is a tool designed for scanning vulnerabilities. It employs methods akin to those used by Nmap to detect and document vulnerabilities. These findings are subsequently presented in a user-friendly graphical interface for examination.

Nessus distinguishes itself from other scanners by its non-presumptive scanning approach. Unlike some tools that make assumptions during scans, such as assuming a web application is operating on port 80, Nessus avoids such assumptions.

Nessus provides both free and paid services, with certain premium features reserved for the paid version. The free version serves as a teaser to encourage users to consider upgrading to the paid service.</p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<div align="center">

<p>I installed Nessus on my host desktop:</p>
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-1.png" alt="" />
  
  <p>Verified that my VM had connection the IP address. This can be done using VMWare and making sure it's connected to our home network in Bridged mode:</p>

  <p>After I got my IP address, I initiated a basic non-credentialed scan on Nessus:</p>

  <p>I went and made a few configurations. I opened Services and enabled Remote Registry which iwll allow the scanner to connect to the VM's registry.
  
  
  Next, I verified that File and Printer Sharing in the Advanced Sharing Settings.

<p>To complete a credentialed scan, I entered the credentials of the VM.</p>

  <p>These were the results after completing a second scan, first credential scan which shows more vulnerabilites with some Criticals and Highs.</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-12.png" alt="" />

<p>I installed a very old version of Firefox</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-8.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-9.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-10.png" alt="" />


  <p>These were the results of the Firefox installation:</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-12.png" alt="" />

  <P> To remediate, I uninstalled Firefox and ran Windows Updates and restarted the Windows 10 VM. I had to run another Windows Update and restart again.</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-14.png" alt="" />
  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-15.png" alt="" />

  <p>After completing another scan, I observed that Internet Explorer was still enabled on this VM. In June 2022, Microsoft announced the Internet Explorer 11 desktop application went out of support for certain operating systems starting June 15, 2022</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-16.png" alt="" />

  <p>Nessus provides information and </p>

  <p>To disable Internet Explorer on the VM, I opened Local Group Policy Editor and navigated to "Disabled Internet Explorer 11 as a standalone browser.</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-18.png" alt="" />

  <p>I also remediated another vulnerability regarding Microsoft 365 Office App Code Execution. This was resolved by opening Microsoft Store and updating many applications.</p>

  <img class="profile-pic" src="images/step-19.png" alt="" />

  <p>I then ran another credentialed scan which remediated most of the majority of the high and critical vulnerabilities. There were some high ones, but not all high vulnerabilities have the same impact or pose the same level of risk. You should prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact on your organization's security and operations. Focus on addressing those that have the most significant risk first.</p>

 <h2>Remediation</h2>

Upon concluding the scans and conducting configuration testing on my Windows 10 virtual machine through Nessus, I proactively addressed the identified issues. This involved the installation of all accessible updates and the removal of an outdated Firefox version, a potential security threat. The primary aim here was to illustrate how applications can significantly influence a system and expose vulnerabilities.

In summary, this project serves as a testament to my grasp of vulnerability management and a foundational understanding of the vulnerability life cycle. It lays the groundwork for my continued progression and advancement in this field.
