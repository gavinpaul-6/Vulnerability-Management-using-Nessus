# Vulnerability Management with Nessus

<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a comprehensive, hands-on walkthrough of the vulnerability scanning and remediation process. It utilizes Nessus Essentials for conducting authenticated scans on virtual machines hosted within VMWare Workstation. Throughout this project, I will demonstrate the steps involved in identifying vulnerabilities, applying remediation measures, and validating their success via a follow-up scan. This hands-on experience contributes significantly to my comprehension of essential aspects within the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.

<h2>Tools Used:</h2>

- Nessus

<h2>Environments:</h2>

- VMWare Workstation Pro
- Windows 10 ISO (21H1)
- Deprecated version of Firefox


<h2>Lab Steps:</h2>

 <h2>Remediation</h2>

Upon concluding the scans and conducting configuration testing on my Windows 10 virtual machine through Nessus, I proactively addressed the identified issues. This involved the installation of all accessible updates and the removal of an outdated Firefox version, a potential security threat. The primary aim here was to illustrate how applications can significantly influence a system and expose vulnerabilities.

In summary, this project serves as a testament to my grasp of vulnerability management and a foundational understanding of the vulnerability life cycle. It lays the groundwork for my continued progression and advancement in this field.
