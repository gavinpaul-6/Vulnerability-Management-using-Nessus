# Vulnerability-Management-using-Nessus

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I created a lab for vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I used  Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.

<h2>Tools Used:</h2>

- VMWare Workstation Pro
- Windows 10 ISO
- Nessus
